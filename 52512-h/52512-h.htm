<p><i>Maggie.</i> 'Pon my sowl, it's the docthor's a jewel,
that he is! Didn't I burn me wid the hot fat, that
made me howl wid the pain uv it? And didn't the
blissid docthor tind me loike his own sisther&mdash;wid the
cooling and haling salve for me fisht, and the wee sugar
pills for the faver that was burnin' me up intirely? And
didn't the blissid crayther, wid the bountiful heart in 'im,
charge niver a cint for it, or sthop it out uv the wages uv
a poor girl, as many a hathen would do, bad luck to 'em.
To be sure he did; and, by that same token, it's Maggie
Mullen would run the wide worrld over for the sakes uv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
him. Och, but it's little docthoring he has onyhow, and
perhaps I did him a sarvice giving him the practice
loike. Will, if the sick folks only knew how handy he
is, there'd be little rist for the sole uv my fut answering
the bill.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Friskey</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span></i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> Hallo, Maggie! Where's the doctor?</p>

<p><i>Maggie.</i> Sure it's at his brikfast he is. Can't you
lit him have a little pace for his sowl? What wid
bein' up all night, and runnin' to sick folks all day, it's
little rist he finds onyhow.</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> That's right, Maggie. Keep up a show of
business if there is none. But I'm in the secret.</p>

<p><i>Maggie.</i> Sacret, is it? Sure there's none.</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> Ah, we know, Maggie, that our friend the
doctor has yet to get his first patient.</p>

<p><i>Maggie.</i> Indade you're wrong there, Masther Frank.
Haven't I been under his charge, and don't I know the
skilful arts uv him? Indade I do, and can give him the
highest characther.</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> O, I forgot that, Maggie. He's made a
commencement. How's your hand, Maggie?</p>

<p><i>Maggie.</i> As comfortable as it can be wid the finest
midical attention.</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> That's good. Well, I'll wait for him. (<i>Sits
at table; takes up newspaper.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Maggie.</i> That's right, sir. He'll be glad to say ye's.
But mind, don't interfare wid his business. Don't tak
his mind off the purshuit uv patients, for it's much they're
wanted, ye's can belave.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit, <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> I do <i>belave</i> it. Now here's a man who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
passed a splendid examination, received his diploma, and
settled down in his native village to practise medicine,
but so set are the good people that they will never
patronize him until age and experience have fitted him to
be their medical adviser. Stuff and nonsense! While
he is growing he must starve, unless some way is found
to move their stubborn will. Not a patient&mdash;no, I'm
wrong&mdash;there's his free patient, Maggie, "The Duchess
of Dublin," as <i>Lucy</i> and I facetiously call her. A free patient!
If we could only contrive to get one of the high and
mighty snobs of the village into his clutches, we'd physic
him until the whole population flocked to his office.
(<i>Knock, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span></i>) Come in. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Lucy Linden</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span></i>) Ah,
Lucy, come in. How d'ye do? (<i>Shake hands.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Where's Adam?</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> The first of men is at his breakfast, replenishing
his exhausted system before renewing the toil of
practice.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> You're too bad, Frank. The dear fellow must
not be laughed at. You know he has no practice.</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> O, there you're wrong. The first patient
has been found.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> You don't mean it? Who is it&mdash;Squire Prim,
or Aunt Lucy Spear, Mr. Plumpface, or Mr. Oldbuck?
Do tell me. I'm dying to know!</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> A person of greater importance. One with
a high-sounding title.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Title&mdash;Judge Higgins? General Proof? You
mysterious fellow, why don't you tell me.</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> It's "The Duchess of Dublin."</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> O, pshaw! Maggie Mullen. Frank Friskey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
you're a torment. I really thought 'twas some distinguished
character.</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> Well, the duchess had a fine <i>characther</i> from
her last place. By Jove! an idea.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Get rid of it, Frank; it's dangerous.</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> Hush! This is really a magnificent idea.
Our doctor must have patients, for several reasons:
First, he is engaged to a beautiful young lady, whom he
will not marry until his practice will allow him to support
her as he desires&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Just as if I cared. I'm sure I'd rather help
him up hill, than to wait for the elegant mansion he
hopes to rear on the summit.</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> There <i>you</i> are interested. In the second
place, his sister is engaged to a fascinating young gentleman,
ahem! and him she will not marry until her brother
can afford to let her leave his house, of which she is the
toiling mistress.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> And there <i>you</i> are interested.</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> Exactly. Therefore we are both interested
in increasing the doctor's practice as soon as possible.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> The sooner the better.</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> Now listen to me. Suppose that a high-born
lady, a titled lady of Europe, should visit this country;
should pass through this village; should suddenly be
taken sick. The aid of our good friend the doctor is required.
He is called in. The news spreads like wildfire
through the village. Patients flock to his office. His
fortune is made, and we are happy in our loves.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Ah, but where can we find such a patient?</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> She's here beneath this humble roof&mdash;"The
Duchess of Dublin," <i>incog.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Lucy.</i> Why, Frank, what a desperate idea!</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> Desperate cases require desperate means.
What say you, will you join me?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> In what way?</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> We will leave this house at once, separate,
you go to the right, I to the left. Drop in here and there
quite accidentally, and, in confidence, disclose the interesting
news that "The Duchess of Dublin," <i>incog.</i>,
is in the skilful hands of Dr. Aconite. Magnify it a
little, and await the result. I am confident that before
night Adam will be as happy as a rush of complicated
disorders can make an M. D.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Capital! only if we are found out&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> We'll laugh it off as a capital joke. If, in
the mean time, Adam gets a good patient, he'll make his
way to a good practice.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> It's an absurd idea to exalt our Maggie to so
high a position. Should anybody see her&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> Ah, but nobody must see her. The duchess
is <i>incog.</i> You must communicate in the strictest confidence,
and have it distinctly understood that not a word
must be said to the doctor about his grand patient.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I understand, and you may depend upon me;
only if the worst comes I shall throw all the responsibility
upon you.</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> And I'll agree to take it all. Come, let's
set out.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Without seeing Adam?</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> Yes, for I shan't trust you with him until
you are fully committed to this arch plot. Come.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> What, would you rob me of a sight of my
Adam?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Friskey.</i> Eve-n so. Am I not robbed of the sight of
my Annie?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Not even one embrace?</p>

<p><i>Friskey.</i> As a substitute embrace me. (<i>Throws his
arms around her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Lucy</i> (<i>screams</i>). You horrid wretch! (<i>Runs off, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span>,
followed by <span class="smcap">Friskey</span>.</i>)</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Dr. Aconite</span> appears, <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span></i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Am I awake? My friend, my bosom friend,
with his arms about my affianced bride! Pills and powders!
pestle and mortar! am I awake? Well, it's my
usual luck. Day by day I've seen my stock of provisions
sensibly decrease. I have this morning devoured the
last fishball that could be manufactured from the slender
stock of codfish and potatoes. It has vanished, and so
has my love, with the friend of my bosom. There's
nothing left for me now but to make a few slender meals
of my sugar-coated pills, fricassee the canary, and then
slowly but surely starve. (<i>Sinks into chair, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span></i>)</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Annie Aconite</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span></i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Annie.</i> Well, brother, what would you like for
dinner?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Dinner? ha, ha! Dinner! Well, what say
you to roast turkey with cranberry sauce?</p>

<p><i>Annie.</i> Brother!</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Or roast goose, with guava jelly?</p>

<p><i>Annie.</i> Brother!</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Or roast buffalo, with venison steak, devilled
kidneys, and salmon, with oyster sauce on the half
shell.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Annie.</i> Adam, are you crazy?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Why not? Our dinner must be an imaginary
one, so let's have it as costly and luxurious as possible.
There's nothing in the larder. Let's be extravagant, and
cook it all.</p>

<p><i>Annie.</i> Why, how you rave! Is the money all gone?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Every cent.</p>

<p><i>Annie.</i> But the butcher?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Would carve me with his meat-axe if I asked
for credit.</p>

<p><i>Annie.</i> Then I'll try him. He won't carve me. Now
don't be despondent. We have always had a dinner,
and, depend upon it, you shall to-day.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i></p>

</div></div>

<p>Annie, why don't you marry Frank Friskey?</p>

<p><i>Annie.</i> Adam, why don't you marry the little milliner?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Because I have no patients.</p>

<p><i>Annie.</i> And I have patience to wait until you get
them before I marry Frank.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> But I never shall have a patient. There's
a dead set against me. They're determined I shall not
cure or kill anybody until I kill myself with waiting.</p>

<p><i>Annie.</i> Not so bad as that, Adam. Be patient, and
wait.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> O, humbug! My instruments are all getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
rusty, my pills old, my plasters cracking, and my drops
drying up. Hang it, I'll go and doctor myself for amusement.
(<i>Knock, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><i>Annie.</i> Hush! Perhaps there's a call.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> The undertaker, perhaps, in search of a job.
Come in.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Dennis</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span></i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> The top uv the mornin' to ye's. Is the docther
man in&mdash;I donno?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Yes, I'm the doctor.</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> Is that so? Yer rivirance, if ye plaze, Squire
Croony wants ye's quick. The ould missus's howlin' in
the pangs uv insinsibility, the young masther's took wid
the jumpin' croup in his skull, and the babby's got the
janders&mdash;an' it's pisoned they all are intirely.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> What, Squire Croony?</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> The same, yer rivirance, onto the hill
beyant.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> O, you've made a mistake. He wants Dr.
Allopath.</p>

I was to sind.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> (<i>rubbing his hands</i>). Ha, ha! that's a capital
joke. Dr. Aconite, poor physician, turns two of the
richest men out of his office to wait his pleasure! But
that's the right way. 'Twill never do to be too anxious.
Egad! they're rich acquisitions; for, though I have
never met them, that cough and that gouty foot have
been the rounds of the medical fraternity. Wonder how
they happened to drop in upon me? No matter; I can
cure them both in time. Ah, Time, you are the doctor's
best friend, for you pay as you go. Luck's come at last,

<blockquote>

<p><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Sharpset</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span></i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sharpset.</i> Heow d'ye dew. You're Dr. Aconite, I
reckon?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> I am.</p>

<p><i>Sharpset.</i> Jes' so. Wall, I'm Silas Sharpset, E. s. q.,
'he founder and proprietor of the "Excelsior Perambulating
Museum of Wonderful, Whimsical, Extraordinary,
and Eccentric Living Curiosities."</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Sharpset.</i> Jes' so. You'll find in my wonderful collection
studies of human nater in every variety. The
remarkable and only original living fat girl, seven years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
of age, who has attained the enormous weight of seven
hundred and seventy-seven pounds by a daily diet of molasses
candy and gum drops.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Remarkable, indeed!</p>

<p><i>Sharpset.</i> Jes' so. Also, the only real living skeleton,
aged thirty-nine, weight seventeen pounds and three
ounces, who lives on oatmeal gruel, eaten by the spoonful,
once in forty-eight hours, who kin crawl through a stove-pipe
of six inches diameter, and dance the Cachuca in
a quart measure.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Ah, that's too thin.</p>

<p><i>Sharpset.</i> Jes' so. Then there's the man born without
either arms or legs, who can lift a hogshead with his
teeth, and write a remarkably legible hand with his back
hair, which he wears in a cue for that purpose.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Cue-rious, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Sharpset.</i> Jes' so. Then there's the bald-headed
accountant, with his head so full of figures that he can
run up the longest account in no time, and, by the force
of his stupendous intellect, make the sum total appear in
round figures, visible to the naked eye, on the top of his
head.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> A calculating baldhead.</p>

<p><i>Sharpset.</i> Jes' so. But the assortment is too numerous
to mention. I kin only say, that for variety, versatility,
and invention, this collection is unsurpassed, and kin be
seen in all its beauty for twenty-five cents a head.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Well, sir, what is your business with me?
My time is precious.</p>

<p><i>Sharpset.</i> Jes' so. Wall, then, to come to the p'int.
You've got a nat'ral living curiosity, and I want it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Dr. A.</i> I've got a curiosity? So I have&mdash;a curiosity
to know what you mean.</p>

<p><i>Sharpset.</i> Jes' so. Mighty secret, but it's no use,
doctor; it's all over town. You'll have to give in, so you
might as well make the best terms you kin with me, for
I've greater facilities for exhibiting the critter than any
other live man. Jes' so&mdash;Silas Sharpset, E. s. q., can't
be beat.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Exhibiting the critter, Mr. Sharpset? There's
a wildness in your eye that betokens insanity. You are
laboring under a wild hallucination. Go hence. Soak
your feet, wrap a wet towel round your head, and return
to your couch at once.</p>

<p><i>Sharpset.</i> Jes' so. Keep it up, doctor. But it won't
fool me. The critter's here. Turn her over to me, bag
and baggage, and I'll pay you a thousand dollars down.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> A thousand dollars&mdash;you'll pay me? Be
calm, my friend, be calm. You betray unmistakable
symptoms of a disordered mind. Will you oblige me
with a little explanation?</p>

<p><i>Sharpset.</i> Jes' so.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Who is the "critter" that you are in pursuit
of?</p>

<p><i>Sharpset.</i> The duchess, of course. Why, consarn it,
it's all over town.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> The duchess? Ah, yes, poor man, lunacy
always takes high flights. Ah, who is the duchess?</p>

<p><i>Sharpset.</i> Jes' so. Doctor, do you see anything of a
verdant hue in this optic? (<i>Finger on left eye.</i>) It's no
use. "The Duchess of Dublin" is in this house; is under
your charge. Now do the handsome thing. I'll put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
her up as an extra attraction, charge double price, and
divide profits. There's an offer.</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> By doubling your price on "The Duchess of
Dublin"? Now, you must excuse the question, but who
is "The Duchess of Dublin"? and what have I to do
with "The Duchess of Dublin"?</p>

<p><i>Sharpset.</i> Consarn it, mister, are you a fool?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> Now gently, friend. Be calm, be calm.
(<i>Aside.</i>) O, he's very crazy!</p>

<p><i>Sharpset.</i> Humbug! Will you, or will you not, accept
my offer? Half profits for the duchess. Sharp's
the word! Quick, or you lose it!</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> My dear friend, it wouldn't hurt you to lose
a little blood. My lancet's handy.</p>

<p><i>Sharpset.</i> Jehoshaphat! do you take me to be an
idiot?</p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> You'd better go home. Your wife and children
are expecting you. No doubt the little folks are
chanting, with their childish voices, "Dear father, dear
father, come home."</p>

<p><i>Sharpset.</i> Jes' so. You can't pull wool over my
eyes, doctor. Silas Sharpset is sharpset by name and
sharpset by nater. You can't fool me. You've got a
prize, and want to keep it for yourself; but if I don't set
the populace howling round your door, and make you
show up the duchess, then you can shave my head, and
lock me up for life. No monopolies here in living curiosities
while Sharpset's around&mdash;not if he knows it:
jes' so.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Dr. A.</i> He's gone&mdash;home, I hope. He's very mad.
Why don't his friends take care of him. It's dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
to let a man run round with such horrid ideas as are
rambling through his brain. The fat girl, the living

Duchess of Dublin." 'Pon my word, the idea of my

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
